K6 Cloud
1. Login to k6 cloud (Grafana)
- to login into k6 cloud use `k6 cloud login`
- enter your email and password

2. Another approach (using api token)
- k6 cloud login --token some-token
= returns
`Logged in successfully, token saved in /filedirectory/Application Support/loadimpact/k6/config.json`
- you only do this once after that you will just run your tests
- run your script just normally but use cloud eg k6 cloud script.js
