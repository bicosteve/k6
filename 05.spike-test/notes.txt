# Spike Test
- This is done to test surprise increase in number of users.
- This is like dropping a huge track on a bridge from a plane!
- Done during new product launch or when there are commercial activities on the tv.
- The number of users will be different from anything which has ever been witnessed before.
- Many users will hit the application but it is expected they will not stick around that much.
- The number of users should be made 4-5 times your load test.
